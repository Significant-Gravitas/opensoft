Feature: Filename Replacer API

  Scenario: Test Can Replace Filenames given a list of modules
    # Check for non-existence of module initially
    When the user asks the module "xyz" to have all the filenames containing "abc" to be replaced with "def"
    Then the system should implement the changes and return a success message with a list of the files changed
